## USer Story

As a foodie,
I want to eat a delicious meal.

When I think about my preferences,
I must decide if I want to prepare food at home, or find a restaurant near me.

On the home-page, I can choose to either “make it” or “buy it”.

If I want to prepare food at home,
Then I click on the “make it” button on the home page.

When I click on the “make it” button, 
Then I am presented with a search bar to look up recipes based on the ingredients I have.

When I type the ingredients I have in the search bar, 
Then I am presented with 10 recipes including the ingredients I searched for.
